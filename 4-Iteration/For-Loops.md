## <table><th>`Iteration Defined`<th></table>
___
**Iteration:**
> * basically: means to loop or repeat
> * specifically: the process of repeating a set of instructions or operations in a sequence, typically within a loop

**Iterables**
> * are data types that can return their values one at a time


Iterable Types include, but are not limited too:
```
*   Strings <class 'str'>
*   Lists <class 'list'>
*   Tuples <class 'tuple'>
*   Sets <class 'set'>
*   Dictionaries <class 'dict'>
*   Iterators (classes that implement the \_\_iter\_\_ method)
*   Generators (a function that returns an iterator)
```
Example of other iterable types in Python:
```  
*   range  
*   bytes 
*   bytearray  
*   frozenset  
*   collections.deque  
*   collections.namedtuple  
*   collections.OrderedDict  
*   collections.defaultdict  
*   collections.ChainMap  
*   collections.Counter  
*   collections.UserDict  
*   collections.UserList  
*   collections.UserString  
*   files (file objects)  
*   generator objects 

``` 

Instead of this:
```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
print(10)
```

Try these:

* While Loops (Iteration)


```python
num = 1
while (num <= 10):
    print(num, end = " ")
    num += 1

#Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```

* For Loops (Iteration)


```python
for num in range(1,11,1):
    print(num, end = " ")

#Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```

* Functions (Recursion)


```python
def count(num, stop, step = 1): #Function Definition
    if num <= stop:
        print(num)
        num += 1
        count(num,stop,step)
    return

count(1,10) #Function Call

#Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```

## <table><th>`Python Indentation and Code Blocks`<th></table>
___

**Python syntax uses indentation to define the scope of blocks of code.**   
**Code blocks are groups of statements that are executed together as a unit.**
> * Each indentation level represents a higher level of code structure (conditionals, loops, functions, classes)
> * All statements within the same block must have the same level of indentation.
> * Indent 4 spaces to create a code block.  
> * The end of a block is indicated by the decrease in indentation level. 

> *Note: Scope is the area of a program in which a block of code exists and executes.*  
<br>

> *Notes:*  
> * *Indentation is typically achieved using spaces or tabs.* 
> * *Don't mix spaces and tabs, it can lead to syntax errors or inconsistent behavior.*   
> * *Python 3 disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation in the same source file.*  
> * *If you are using an editor like VScode using the tab key, and spaces is not a problem.*   



### Python Indentation Abstract Examples:


```python
condition = True or False

if(condition):
    #start of the if code block (scope/context)
    print("Inside the if statement")                    
                                                        
#end of the if code block (scope/context)
```


```python
condition = True or False

while(condition):
    #start of the while code block (scope/context)
    print("Inside the while loop")

#end of the while code block (scope/context)
```


```python
for _ in range(10):
    #start of the for code block (scope/context)
    print("Inside the for loop")

#end of the for code block (scope/context)
```


```python
def function_():
    #start of the function definition code block (scope/context)
    print("Inside of the function definition")

#end of the function definition code block (scope/context)
```


```python
class Class_():
    #start of the Class definition code block (scope/context)

    def __init__(self):
        # start of the Class Constructor Definition code block (scope/context)
        print("Inside the Class, inside the constructor")

    # end of the Class Constructor Definition code block (scope/context)
# end of the Class Definition code block (scope/context)
```

### Nested Indentation: Blocks inside of Blocks
> Indentation defines the level of the code block when nesting constructs

> Note:   
> Most code editors like VS Code will provide a line to help you keep track of the beginning and end of your code blocks



```python
class Example():
    def example_():
        for _ in range(5):
            while(condition):
                if(condition):
                    print("So many indents!")
```

```python
class Example():#start of class code block~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
    def example_():                                                 #

## <table><th>`For Loop Syntax`<th></table>
___
**for loop**
> * basically: repeat a code block a finite number of times
> * specifically: a control flow statement that iterates over a sequence of elements in an iterable object

> * The *for* keyword defines the start of a for loop
> * Each for loop has a loop variable that appears after the *for* keyword
> * Each for loop in python uses the 'in' keyword after the loop variable
>    * It signifies the loop variable will take on each value from the iterable in turn
> * A for loop, iterates through an iterable type placed after the 'in' keyword
> * a ':' is used to indicate the start of the block of code to be repeated

`Note: for loop syntax in Python is different than most languages`

abstract example:
```python
iterable_object = ...

for loop_variable in iterable_object: #This line is called the for loop header
    #indent 4 spaces to be inside the loop block
    'repeat this code block'
#unindent 4 spaces to exit the loop block
```
```python
iterable_object = ...

#--------------------------------------#
for variable in iterable_object: #     #         
    'repeat this code block'     #     #
    #----------------------------#     #
#--------------------------------------# 
```
real example:
```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num, end = " ")
```

## Comparing for loop syntax between languages

example: Print out each number from 0 to 5.  

> NOTE:  
> *Most commonly used programming languages use a similiar syntax for writing for loops. 
> Python deviates from this common syntax in several ways, however since it is likely that you will encounter these other languages it is important to see the similarities. 
> Therefore we will begin by showing you how to count using for loops with a  "start, stop, step" syntax as this most closely translates to other languages.
> Examples of for loop syntax in multiple languages is shown below.*

Python
```python
for i in range(0,6,1):
    print(i, end = " ")
```

Java
```java
for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++){
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}
```

Javascript
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++){
    console.log(i + " ");
}
```
C\+\+
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

C#
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    Console.Write(i + " ");
}
```

Go
```go
for i := 0; i < 6; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
}
```

Rust
```rust
for i in 0..6 {
    print!("{} ", i);
}
```

Lua
```lua
for i = 0, 5 do
    io.write(i .. " ")
end
```

Bash
```bash
for (( i = 0; i < 6; i++ )); do
    echo -n "$i "
done
```

Powershell
```powershell
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 6; $i++) {
    Write-Host -NoNewline "$i "
}
```
Swift
```swift
for i in 0..<6 {
    print("\(i) ", terminator: "")
}
```
## <table><th>`The range() constructor`<th></table>
___
> * the range() constructor constructs a range object that is an iterable sequence of numbers
> * range() returns a range of number from start to stop-1

> * The range() constructor has 3 parameters (start, stop, step)
>    * These parameters define the range of numbers that is constructed
>    * The 'start' is always included in the range
>    * The 'stop' is always excluded, thus the last number in the range is stop-1 for ascending ranges, and stop+1 for descending ranges

abstract example:
```python
start,stop,step = ... #just place holders

'The range() constructor has 3 parameters (start, stop, step)'
#returns a range of numbers from start to stop-1. 
range(start, stop, step)
```
real example:
```python
range(0,11,1) # Returns: a range from 0 to 10 by 1s
```

### The default start value is 0:
> * Only works for ascending ranges where the step is 1

abstract example:
```python
stop = ... #place holder

'The range() constructor has 3 parameters (start, stop, step)'
#returns a range of numbers from start to stop-1. 
range(stop)
```
real examples:
```python
range(11)   # Returns: a range from 0 to 10 by 1s
range(6)    # Returns: a range from 0 to 5 by 1s
range(30)   # Returns: a range from 0 to 29 by 1s
```

### The default step is 1
> * This means ranges by default are ascending, you must specify both the start and step to create descending ranges

abstract example:
```python
start,stop= ... #just place holders

'The range() constructor has 3 parameters (start, stop, step)'
#returns a range of numbers from start to stop-1. 
range(start, stop)
```
real examples:
```python
range(5,20)     # Returns: a range from 5 to 19 by 1s
range(50,67)    # Returns: a range from 50 to 66 by 1s
range(100,1001) # Returns: a range from 100 to 1000 by 1s
```

Other real range examples:
> * start is included (default is 0)  
> * stop is not included (+1 if going up or -1 if going down)  
> * step (default is 1) 

```python
range(0,10,1)       # Returns: a range from 0 to 9 by 1s
range(10)           # Returns: a range from 0 to 9 by 1s
range(10,0,-1)      # Returns: a range from 10 to 1 by 1s
range(-5,6,1)       # Returns: a range from -5 to 5 by 1s
range(5,-6,-1)      # Returns: a range from 5 to -5 by 1s
```
## <table><th>`Counting with For Loops`<th></table>
___
> * The use of the letter i as a control variable in loops is a long-standing convention in programming.   
> * This practice dates back to early computing and mathematical notation, where i often represents an index or iterator.

> These following letters are commonly used as control variables:
> * i
> * j
> * k
> * n

**General Syntax for Counting with For Loops**
```python
for number in range(start,stop,step):   # for loop header
    print(number, end = " ")            # prints the value of number, and  adds a single space
```
## <table><th>`Ascending: Counting up by 1 and by Multiples`<th></table>
___
> * The 'stop' is always excluded, thus the last number in the range is stop-1 for ascending ranges. 
>   * For example: if you want to stop at 5 then stop should equal 6

`Note: all of the for loops in python are for each loops by design. This is not the case in all languages.`

For-Each syntax:
```
for variable in iterable:
    <Code Block to Execute Repeatedly>  
```

abstract example:
```python
iterable = ... #place holder

for variable in iterable:
    'code block to execute'
#iterables are something that can be repeated through 
# strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc. are iterable
```

real examples:
```python
string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

for character in string:

#Output: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
```
```python
list1d = ["list","tuple","set","dictionary","iterators"]

#element does not represent an index, but the actual element. 
for element in list1d:
    print(element, end = " ")

#Output: list tuple set dictionary iterators 
```
```python
tuple1d = ("list","tuple","set","dictionary","iterators")

#element does not represent an index, but the actual element. 
for element in tuple1d:
    print(element, end = " ")

#Output: list tuple set dictionary iterators 
```
```python
set1d = {"list","tuple","set","dictionary","iterators"}

#element does not represent an index, but the actual element. 
for element in set1d:
    print(element, end = " ")

#Output order will vary with a set: 
# Output: list tuple set dictionary iterators 
```
```python
dictionary = {"list":None,"tuple":None,"set":None,"dictionary":None,"iterators":None}

for key in dictionary.keys():
    print(key, end = " ")

#Output: list tuple set dictionary iterators
```
real example use case:   
```python

sum = 0
for num in nums:
    sum += num

print(sum)

#Output: 15

___


## Break
**break**
> * basically: statement used to end a loop early
> * specifically: statement used to exit (or "break out of") the loop prematurely. 

> * use: commonly used within loops like for and while to interrupt the loop's execution based on a certain condition.


abstract example:
```python
for variable in iterable:
    break
```

real example: Checking Prime Numbers
```python
for n in range(2,10):
    for x in range(2,n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print(n,"equals",x,"*",n//x)
            break
    #loop fell through without finding a factor
    else:
        print(n,"is a prime number")
#the loop will exit on the first loop
```

## Continue

**continue**
> * basically: a statement that skips the rest of code block in the current loop.
> * specifically: a statement used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration, and continue with the next iteration of the loop.

abstract example:
```python
for variable in iterable:
    continue
```

real example:
```python
#Not printing values divisible by 7
for x in range(50):
    if(x % 7 == 0):
        continue #skips the rest of the code block, and starts the next loop.
    else:
        print(x)
```

## Pass
**pass**
> * basically: is a placeholder
> * specifically:  is a placeholder statement that does nothing when executed. 

> * use: used when a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed. This can be useful in situations where code is being written incrementally, or when a function or loop is meant to be implemented later.

abstract example:
```python
for variable in iterable:
    pass
```
